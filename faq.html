<h3>What is the purpose of this site?</h3>
The purpose of this site is to help ColdFusion developers solve common problems. The site is organized into a set of categories and questions. Each question has an answer that tries to be as simple as possible. The hope is that the reader will come to the site with a problem - find a matching question - and be able to leave with a good solution.

<h3>What version of ColdFusion will the site's code support?</h3>
This site was written to support ColdFusion 10, the latest version of the product. However, many of the entries will work just fine in earlier versions of the product.

<h3>Can I submit content?</h3>
<p>
Yes! Please go to our <a href="http://www.coldfusioncookbook.com/submit.html">submit</a> page. Your submission will be checked sometime soon after your submission. It will most likely be edited. You will be credited for your submission. In general - problems and answers should be very atomic. This would be a bad entry: How do I build a CMS? This too: What is "good" ColdFusion coding? These are good entries: How do I display the current time? How do I prevent forms from being submitted twice?

<h3>Can I submit just a question?</h3>
<p>
Yes! Please go to our <a href="http://www.coldfusioncookbook.com/submit">submit</a> page. You 
do not need to submit an answer. If we feel your question is appropriate, we will try to answer it
as soon as possible. In this case, the writer of the answer will be credited for the entry.

<h3>I submitted a question, but I see someone elses name on it!</h3>
I've gotten multiple submissions with (basically) the same content. Typically I'll pick the first person as the author.
