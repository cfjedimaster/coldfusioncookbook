<h3>Welcome to the ColdFusion Cookbook.</h3>

<p>
I'd like to welcome you to the ColdFusion Cookbook. The purpose of this site is simple - help
people solve problems. Many of the problems that developers encounter are problems that we have all encountered.
This site was created in January of 2006. It was the creation of <a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com">Raymond Camden</a>, but many
people had a hand in helping create this site and the content found within.
</p>

<p>
There are currently <b>{{ collections.entries | size }}</b> entries released!
</p>

<h3>Recent Entries</h3>

{% assign entries = collections.entries %}
<p>
{% for entry in entries limit:10 %}
	<a href="{{ entry.url }}">{{ entry.data.title }}</a><br/>
{% endfor %}
