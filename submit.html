<h3>Submit</h3>

<p>
Please follow the following guidelines when submitting your entry:
<ul>
<li>The topic should be very simple and direct. It should cover one topic only. 
<li>Your code should use latest ColdFusion functionality whenever possible.
<li>For blocks of code, surround them with &lt;code&gt; and &lt;/code&gt; tags.
<li>Tags should include a &lt; and &gt; and be in camel case. Example: &lt;cfdirectory newDirectory="...." &gt;)
<li>Functions should also be in camel case and should include (). Example: result = fileExists(...)
<li>Yes, some entries here do not follow the standard. We will fix it... soon.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
